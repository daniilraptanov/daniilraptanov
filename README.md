## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics.

I'm really fascinated by computer technologies. My main domain is web.<br>
Also I have interests in embedded area.

Besides I appreciate hobbies without information technology, like analog photography, poetry, reading or table role-playing games.

Currently I'm focused on such tech stacks: Python3 (Flask, SqlAlchemy, Alembic), Node.JS (Express, Sequelize), React.JS with Redux.<br>But I'm convinced that technologies are not as important as approaches and right thinking.


# software engineering

I have full-stack development experience since 2021. I have worked with Python (Flask, SQLAlchemy), frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS/TS, React, Redux), object-relational databases (PostgreSQL), and Node.js (Express.js, Sequelize).

I studied computer engineering at **Kharkiv Radiotechnical College** and am currently continuing my studies at **Kharkiv National University of Radioelectronics**. Additionally, I completed the **SoftServe IT Academy (2022â€“2023) course** â€” *"DevOps Fundamentals: Team Project Stage"*, where I learned CI/CD concepts and gained experience with Docker, Terraform, AWS, and other tools.

## Skills

- Understanding the principles of **OOP** and **FP**  
- Applying **design patterns** in practice  
- Understanding the **MVC approach**  
- Knowledge of **algorithms**  
- Familiarity with **computer networks**
