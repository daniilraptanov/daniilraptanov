## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics.

I'm really fascinated by computer technologies. My main domain is web.<br>
Also I have interests in embedded area.

Besides I appreciate hobbies without information technology, like analog photography, poetry, reading or table role-playing games.

Currently I'm focused on such tech stacks: Python3 (Flask, SqlAlchemy, Alembic), Node.JS (Express, Sequelize), React.JS with Redux.<br>But I'm convinced that technologies are not as important as approaches and right thinking.
